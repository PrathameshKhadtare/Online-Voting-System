# Online Voting System

"I've created an online voting system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and an SQL database. The HTML and CSS build the user interface, providing an intuitive platform for voters. JavaScript enhances interactivity. PHP manages server-side functionalities, handling user authentication and vote processing. The SQL database securely stores voter information and ballot results, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the voting process. This project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack web development and database management."
